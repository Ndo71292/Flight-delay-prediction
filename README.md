# Flight-delay-prediction
### Introduction
Flight delays not only irritate air passengers and disrupt their schedules but also cause :

a decrease in efficiency an increase in capital costs, reallocation of flight crews and aircraft an additional crew expenses As a result, on an aggregate basis, an airline's record of flight delays may have a negative impact on passenger demand.

This competition aims to predict the estimated duration of flight delays per flight

This solution proposes to build a flight delay predictive model using Machine Learning techniques. The accurate prediction of flight delays will help all players in the air travel ecosystem to set up effective action plans to reduce the impact of the delays and avoid loss of time, capital and resources.

Tunisair is the flag carrier airline of Tunisia. Formed in 1948, it operates scheduled international services to four continents. Its main base is Tunisâ€“Carthage International Airport. The airline's head office is in Tunis, near Tunis Airport. Tunisair is a member of the Arab Air Carriers Organization

### Evaluation
The metric used for this challenge is Root Mean Square Error.
